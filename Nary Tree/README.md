This project includes a linked N-ary tree and a tree in which each node is represented by a node. These shapes can only connect together in a very specific way outlined in the assignment.

The files I created are LinkedNaryTree.java, NaryTreeNode.java, and ShapeTree.java, and the rest were created by the professor.
